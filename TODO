See about doing a blanket impl of Field for Vec<T> where T: Field

Reorder fields according to tag in the plugin as well as the code generator.


* Only support optional, repeated, and packed fields. Optional and repeated
  fields are never wrapped in Option. Support default values for each.
    * Default value on an optional field:
        * encoding: if the value in the struct == the default, don't send it.
        * decoding: the field defaults to the default value if no other value is
                    decoded.
    * Default values on a required field:
        * encoding: default values are always encoded.
        * decoding: default value doesn't matter - the value must be decoded.
